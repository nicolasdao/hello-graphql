# hello-graphql
Just a test to play with GraphQL and Google Cloud Functions. Plan is:

- Get familiar with Google Cloud Functions
- Understanding a classic dev. and deployment workflow
- Add some basic authentication (hopefully using OAuth without to much drama)
- Create a GraphQL example using graphql.js
